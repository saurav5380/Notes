Prisma is an **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** tool that simplifies database access in modern Node.js applications. It acts as an intermediary between your application and the database, allowing you to query, create, update, and delete data without writing raw SQL queries. It supports popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB.

Imagine you're in a library (your database), and you want to ask the librarian for a specific book. Prisma is like an assistant who translates your request into a form the librarian (the database) understands, so you don’t have to go directly to the stacks to search. Instead of speaking SQL, you communicate in JavaScript or TypeScript, and Prisma handles the translation for you.

### Key Concepts in Prisma

1. **Prisma Client**:
Prisma Client is the auto-generated library that provides methods to interact with your database. When you define your data models, Prisma generates methods you can call to do things like:
    - Fetch records (`findMany`, `findUnique`)
    - Create records (`create`)
    - Update records (`update`)
    - Delete records (`delete`)
    
    **Analogy**: Think of the Prisma Client as a phonebook that gives you predefined ways to contact different services in your database. Instead of needing to know everyone's phone number (writing SQL), you just call the function for the right task (use the generated method).
    
2. **Prisma Schema**:
The Prisma schema is a central configuration file (typically named `schema.prisma`) that defines your database models, relationships, and other configurations like the database connection. Here’s what it contains:
    - **Data model**: Defines the structure of your database tables.
    - **Database provider**: Specifies which database you're using (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
    
    **Analogy**: Imagine this schema as the blueprint for constructing a building. It details what rooms (tables) are in the building, what furniture (columns) each room holds, and how the rooms connect (relationships between tables).
    
3. **Migrations**:
When you modify your schema, you’ll need to reflect these changes in the actual database. Migrations are files that track changes in the database schema over time, like adding new tables or altering existing ones.
    
    **Analogy**: If your database is like a garden, migrations are like planting new seeds (adding tables or columns) or trimming existing plants (modifying columns). Prisma creates instructions for these gardening tasks, ensuring your database stays in sync with your schema.
    

### Setting up Prisma ORM

Let’s go through how Prisma fits into a typical Node.js project, using step-by-step actions:

1. **Install Prisma**:
To get started with Prisma, you need to install it in your Node.js project:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    npm install @prisma/client
    npx prisma init
    
    ```
    
    The command `npx prisma init` sets up the basic folder structure and generates the `schema.prisma` file, where you define your models.
    
2. **Defining Models**:
Inside the `schema.prisma` file, you'll define your database tables as models. For example, if you're building a blog, you might define `User` and `Post` models like this:
    
    ```
    prisma
    Copy code
    model User {
      id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
      name  String
      email String  @unique
      posts Post[]
    }
    
    model Post {
      id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
      title     String
      content   String
      author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
      authorId  Int
    }
    
    ```
    
    **Explanation**:
    
    - `User` and `Post` are two tables.
    - The `id` fields are auto-incrementing primary keys.
    - The `email` is marked as `@unique`, meaning no two users can have the same email.
    - The `Post` model has a relationship with `User` through the `author` field, indicating that each post is written by a specific user.
3. **Running Migrations**:
Once you’ve defined your models, you can push these changes to the database:
    
    ```bash
    
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    
    ```
    
    This command will create the necessary tables and relationships in your database based on your schema.
    
4. **Using Prisma Client**:
After setting up the schema and running migrations, you can now use Prisma Client to interact with your database. Here’s an example of how you might create a new user and a post:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
    const prisma = new PrismaClient();
    
    async function main() {
      const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
        data: {
          name: 'Alice',
          email: 'alice@example.com',
          posts: {
            create: {
              title: 'My first post',
              content: 'Hello World!',
            },
          },
        },
      });
    
      console.log(newUser);
    }
    
    main()
      .catch((e) => {
        console.error(e);
      })
      .finally(async () => {
        await prisma.$disconnect();
      });
    
    ```
    
    **Explanation**:
    
    - `prisma.user.create` creates a new user, and in this case, it also creates a related post in one go.
    - The Prisma Client allows you to chain these operations easily, without needing to write complex SQL queries.
5. **Querying Data**:
Prisma also makes it easy to fetch data. For example, to retrieve all users with their posts, you can use:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
      include: { posts: true },
    });
    
    ```
    
    **Explanation**: This will fetch all users and include their related posts in the result.
    

### Directives in Prisma

- **Directives** in Prisma are annotations that provide additional metadata about a model or field in the schema.
- They instruct Prisma on how to handle certain behaviors for that model or field, such as defining primary keys, setting default values, specifying relations, and more.

### Example of Common Directives in Prisma:

1. **`@id`**: Marks a field as the primary key.
    
    ```
    
    id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    ```
    
    - This directive tells Prisma that the `id` field is the primary key of the table.
2. **`@default`**: Specifies a default value for a field.
    
    ```
    
    createdAt DateTime @default(now())
    ```
    
    - This sets the default value for the `createdAt` field to the current timestamp.
3. **`@relation`**: Defines relationships between models (like foreign keys).
    
    ```
    
    author    User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
    ```
    
    - This directive tells Prisma how models are related through foreign keys.
4. **`@unique`**: Ensures that the field values are unique.
    
    ```
    
    email String @unique
    ```
    
    - This guarantees that no two records can have the same value for the `email` field.

### How Directives Work:

- Directives modify the behavior of a field or model, adding special constraints or instructions on how Prisma should interact with that part of the schema.
- They play a crucial role in defining relationships, constraints, and the structure of your database.

### Creating Primary and Foreign Keys in Prisma

**Primary Key**

To create a primary key in Prisma we first declare the column name, followed by the data type just like other columns. Then we need to add @id and @default(autoincrement()) to make the column as the primary key for the table. 

consider that, there is a field called userId in a Model called User which needs to be declared as a Primary key, then it can be done in the following way: 

```jsx
userId Int @id @default(autoincrement())
```

**Foreign Key**

Defining a foreign key in Prisma has a two step approach: 

1. We define the relation using the @relation directive. The @relation directive contains details about the relation being defined, which includes the primary key, which needs to act as the foreign key and the column which is being designated as the foreign key.
2. Creating the foreign key column with the appropriate data type.

```jsx
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
  posts Post[]  // One-to-many relationship with Post
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])  // Relation field
  authorId  Int     // Foreign key to User
}
```

In Prisma, the `**author**` field in the `Post` model represents the **relation field**, which provides access to the related data—in this case, the **`User`** associated with the `Post`. It is distinct from the `**authorId**` field, which is the **foreign key** used to store the reference to the related record.

### Difference Between `authorId` and `author`:

1. **`authorId`**:
    - This is the **foreign key** field in the `Post` table that holds the `id` of the related `User`.
    - In the database, this is stored as an integer that refers to a specific `User` (the `id` of the user).
2. **`author`**:
    - This is the **relation field** in the `Post` model.
    - It doesn't exist as a column in the database. Instead, it’s used in your Prisma schema and Prisma Client to give you easy access to the related `User` data.
    - You can use this field in queries to include or fetch the associated user for each post.

### How They Work Together:

- **`authorId`**: Links the `Post` to a `User` by storing the user's `id` (foreign key).
- **`author`**: Lets you access the full `User` data when querying `Post` records, providing a convenient way to work with the relation between the `Post` and the `User`.

### Querying with Prisma:

When you're querying a `Post` and you want to include the related `User` data, you use the `author` field. Here’s an example:

### Query Example:

```jsx

const postWithAuthor = await prisma.post.findUnique({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    author: true,  // Include the related User data
  },
});

console.log(postWithAuthor);
```

- In this query, the `author` field allows you to include the associated `User` (the author) with the post.
- Prisma will fetch the user data from the `User` table based on the foreign key (`authorId`).

### Query Result:

```json

{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Prisma Post",
  "content": "Hello Prisma!",
  "authorId": 1,  // Foreign key to the User
  "author": {     // Related User data
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  }
}

```

### How It Works:

- **`authorId`** is stored in the `Post` table as an integer, linking the post to the `User` with that `id`.
- **`author`** is not a column in the database, but Prisma uses it to retrieve and include the full `User` data in the result when you query `Post`.

Q. How is Prisma able to recognise that authorId is the foreign key? There is no special directive written against the authorId column.  

Prisma is able to recognise that **`authorId`** is a foreign key due to the **`@relation`** attribute in the schema. Let's break it down step by step to understand how this works.

### How Prisma Recognises a Foreign Key

Prisma recognises foreign keys through the **`@relation`** attribute, which you define in your model. In the case of the **`authorId`** field in the `Post` model, Prisma knows it is a foreign key because it is explicitly referenced in the **`@relation`** directive.

Here’s the key part of your schema:

```

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())   // Primary key
  title     String
  content   String
  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])  // Relation definition
  authorId  Int     // Foreign key to User.id
}
```

- **`@relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])`**: This line explicitly defines the relationship between the `Post` model and the `User` model.
    - **`fields: [authorId]`**: Tells Prisma that `authorId` in the `Post` model is the **foreign key**.
    - **`references: [id]`**: Specifies that the `authorId` field references the `id` field in the `User` model.

By including this **`@relation`** directive, Prisma understands that:

1. **`authorId`** is the foreign key in the `Post` table.
2. **`authorId`** refers to the **`id`** field in the **`User`** table.

### How It Differs from the Primary Key (`@id`)

- For **primary keys**, you use `@id` and `@default(autoincrement())` to indicate that this field is a unique identifier for records in the table. Prisma needs this information for every table to designate the primary key.
- For **foreign keys**, you don’t need to specify them with additional attributes like `@id` or `@default(autoincrement())`. Instead, the **`@relation`** directive takes care of defining the foreign key relationship.

In other words:

- **`@id`** is required for a primary key because Prisma needs to know how to uniquely identify records.
- **Foreign keys** like `authorId` are specified through the `@relation` attribute, which tells Prisma which field in the current model acts as a foreign key and what it references in the related model.

### Breakdown of the `@relation` Attribute:

Let’s dive deeper into the **`@relation`** attribute and its two key parts:

1. **`fields: [authorId]`**:
    - This specifies that `authorId` is the field in the `Post` model that stores the foreign key.
    - This field will contain the `id` of the related `User`.
2. **`references: [id]`**:
    - This specifies that `authorId` references the `id` field in the `User` model.
    - Prisma uses this information to understand that the `Post` is linked to a `User` via the `User.id` field.

### Implicit and Explicit Many-To-Many relationships in Prisma

In Prisma, **Many-to-Many relationships** can be represented in two different ways: **Implicit** and **Explicit**. Both approaches define relationships between two models where one record from each model can be related to multiple records from the other model. The main difference lies in how you handle the relationship table (also called a "join table" or "pivot table") in the database.

---

## **1. Implicit Many-to-Many Relationship**

### What is an Implicit Many-to-Many Relationship?

In an **implicit Many-to-Many relationship**, Prisma automatically creates an intermediate "join table" for you, which stores the foreign key references between the two models. This is the simplest and most convenient way to define Many-to-Many relationships in Prisma because you don't need to manually define the join table.

### Example:

Let's say you have two models: `User` and `Post`. A user can like many posts, and a post can be liked by many users. This is a classic Many-to-Many relationship.

### Prisma Schema (Implicit):

```
l
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
  likedPosts Post[] @relation("UserLikesPost")  // Many-to-many relation
}

model Post {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  content  String
  likedBy  User[]  @relation("UserLikesPost")   // Many-to-many relation
}

```

### Key Points:

- **No explicit join table** is defined.
- Prisma automatically generates the intermediate table for you behind the scenes.
- The `likedPosts` field in `User` and `likedBy` field in `Post` are arrays (`[]`), indicating the many-to-many relationship.
- The `@relation` directive (`@relation("UserLikesPost")`) tells Prisma how the two models are connected.

### How It Works:

Prisma will automatically create an intermediate table (e.g., `_UserToPost`) that contains:

- A foreign key to the `User` table.
- A foreign key to the `Post` table.

This join table allows you to associate many users with many posts.

### Generated SQL Join Table:

```sql
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE "_UserToPost" (
  "A" INT REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "B" INT REFERENCES "Post"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY ("A", "B")
);

```

Here, `_UserToPost` is the join table created by Prisma, with `A` being the foreign key for `User.id` and `B` being the foreign key for `Post.id`.

---

## **2. Explicit Many-to-Many Relationship**

### What is an Explicit Many-to-Many Relationship?

In an **explicit Many-to-Many relationship**, you manually define the **join table** in your Prisma schema. This gives you more control over the relationship and allows you to add additional fields (like timestamps or metadata) to the join table. This approach is useful when you need to track extra information about the relationship itself.

### Example:

Let’s extend the previous example. This time, we want to explicitly define a join table called `Like`, which tracks when a user liked a post (i.e., we want to store a timestamp in the relationship).

### Prisma Schema (Explicit):

```
prisma
Copy code
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
  likes Like[]  // Explicit relation via 'Like' join table
}

model Post {
  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title    String
  content  String
  likedBy  Like[]  // Explicit relation via 'Like' join table
}

model Like {
  userId Int
  postId Int
  likedAt DateTime @default(now())  // Track when the post was liked

  user   User  @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])  // Foreign key to User
  post   Post  @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])  // Foreign key to Post

  @id([userId, postId])  // Composite primary key (userId + postId)
}

```

### Key Points:

- **`Like`** is an explicit join table between `User` and `Post`.
- The `Like` model includes extra metadata (`likedAt` field) to track when a user liked a post.
- The `@relation` directive defines the foreign keys (`userId` and `postId`) and connects them to the primary keys of the `User` and `Post` models.
- **`@id([userId, postId])`** defines a **composite primary key**, meaning the combination of `userId` and `postId` must be unique.

### How It Works:

- When a user likes a post, an entry is created in the `Like` table with the `userId`, `postId`, and `likedAt` timestamp.
- You have full control over this join table and can add any extra fields or constraints you need.

### Generated SQL Join Table:

In this case, the join table `Like` is explicitly created and would look something like this in SQL:

```sql

CREATE TABLE "Like" (
  "userId" INT REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "postId" INT REFERENCES "Post"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "likedAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY ("userId", "postId")
);

```

## **Differences Between Implicit and Explicit Many-to-Many Relationships**

| Aspect | Implicit Many-to-Many | Explicit Many-to-Many |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Join Table** | Automatically generated by Prisma | Manually defined in the schema |
| **Control over Join Table** | Limited (cannot add extra fields) | Full control (can add fields like `likedAt`) |
| **Custom Metadata** | Not possible (since the table is managed by Prisma) | Possible (you can add fields like timestamps, roles, etc.) |
| **Schema Simplicity** | Simple and minimal schema | Requires an additional model (the join table) |
| **Use Cases** | Ideal for simple many-to-many relationships | Ideal when you need extra data or constraints on the relationship |
| **Generated SQL** | Prisma auto-generates the join table | You define the join table in the Prisma schema |

### When to Use Which:

- **Implicit Many-to-Many**: If you have a simple many-to-many relationship and don't need any extra fields in the join table (just linking two models), the implicit relationship is ideal. It keeps your schema clean and simple.
- **Explicit Many-to-Many**: If you need additional fields in the join table (e.g., timestamps, roles, permissions) or you want more control over how the relationship is managed, an explicit relationship is better.

---

### Querying in Prisma:

### Querying Implicit Many-to-Many:

For an implicit relationship, querying might look like this:

```jsx

const userWithLikedPosts = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    likedPosts: true,  // Include the posts that this user liked
  },
});

```

### Querying Explicit Many-to-Many:

For an explicit relationship, you can query the `Like` table to fetch data, including the extra fields:

```jsx

const userLikes = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: 1 },
  include: {
    likes: {
      include: {
        post: true,  // Include the related post data
      },
    },
  },
});

```

---

### Conclusion:

- **Implicit Many-to-Many** relationships are simpler to set up and are managed entirely by Prisma, which generates the join table behind the scenes. It’s useful for straightforward relationships.
- **Explicit Many-to-Many** relationships give you more control over the join table, allowing you to store additional metadata and define custom constraints on the relationship.

### Relation Names in Prisma

### What is `"UserLikesPost"`?

In this case, `"UserLikesPost"` is a **relation name**, which is just a label given to the relationship between the `User` and `Post` models. Prisma uses this name internally to identify that the two fields (`likedPosts` and `likedBy`) are part of the **same relationship**. This label is especially important in **Many-to-Many** relationships, where the same two models can have multiple different relationships.

However, in **Implicit Many-to-Many relationships**, you do not explicitly define foreign keys or the join table yourself. Instead, Prisma automatically creates an intermediate **join table** that includes the foreign keys pointing to the `User` and `Post` models. You won't see `userId` or `postId` directly in your schema because Prisma manages this under the hood.

### Should There Be Foreign Keys?

In **Implicit Many-to-Many relationships**, you do **not** define foreign key columns in your Prisma schema explicitly. Instead, Prisma automatically creates a **join table** (also known as a pivot table) behind the scenes that stores the foreign key relationships. In this case, the `User` and `Post` models are connected through the join table, and you do not need to manually define the `userId` and `postId` fields in the models.

### Example of the Join Table Prisma Generates:

If you define your schema like this:

```

model User {
  id         Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name       String
  email      String  @unique
  likedPosts Post[]  @relation("UserLikesPost")  // Many-to-many relation
}

model Post {
  id      Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title   String
  content String
  likedBy User[]  @relation("UserLikesPost")     // Many-to-many relation
}

```

Prisma will automatically generate an intermediate table that looks something like this in SQL:

```sql

CREATE TABLE "_UserLikesPost" (
  "A" INT REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "B" INT REFERENCES "Post"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  PRIMARY KEY ("A", "B")
);

```

In this case:

- **`"A"`** is the foreign key pointing to `User.id`.
- **`"B"`** is the foreign key pointing to `Post.id`.

You don’t have to define these fields manually in the Prisma schema; Prisma handles this automatically when you specify an implicit Many-to-Many relationship.

---

### Why Do You Use the `@relation` Directive?

The `@relation` directive with `"UserLikesPost"` is used to **name** and **link** the relationship. Without naming the relationship, Prisma might get confused, especially if there are multiple relationships between the same models. In this case, both `likedPosts` and `likedBy` are referring to the same relationship, so you use the `@relation("UserLikesPost")` directive to make that clear.

- **`likedPosts`** in the `User` model refers to the posts liked by the user.
- **`likedBy`** in the `Post` model refers to the users who liked the post.

Both fields share the same `@relation("UserLikesPost")` directive to indicate that they are part of the same Many-to-Many relationship.

### Why No Foreign Keys in Implicit Many-to-Many?

In an **Implicit Many-to-Many** relationship:

- Prisma takes care of the underlying join table.
- You don't need to define the foreign keys (`userId`, `postId`) explicitly in the schema.
- Instead, Prisma will automatically create a hidden join table (`_UserLikesPost`) and use it to connect `User` and `Post`.

---

### When Do You Define Foreign Keys?

You explicitly define foreign keys in **Explicit Many-to-Many relationships**. If you want to manage the join table yourself (for example, if you want to add custom fields like timestamps or extra metadata), you would define an additional model to represent the join table, along with foreign keys.

### Example of Explicit Many-to-Many:

```jsx

model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String @unique
  likes Like[]  // Connect to Like join table
}

model Post {
  id      Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title   String
  content String
  likedBy Like[]  // Connect to Like join table
}

model Like {
  userId Int
  postId Int
  likedAt DateTime @default(now())

  user   User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])  // Foreign key to User
  post   Post @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])  // Foreign key to Post

  @id([userId, postId])  // Composite primary key
}

```

In this example:

- **`Like`** is the explicit join table.
- **`userId`** and **`postId`** are the foreign key fields connecting the `User` and `Post` models, respectively.
- The `@relation` directive explicitly defines the foreign key references.

---

### Summary:

- In an **Implicit Many-to-Many relationship** (like the one in your code), Prisma automatically handles the join table and foreign keys behind the scenes, so you don't need to manually define them.
- The **`@relation("UserLikesPost")`** directive is used to name and connect the two sides of the relationship (`likedPosts` and `likedBy`) and ensure Prisma knows they are part of the same relationship.
- If you need more control or want to add custom fields to the join table, you would use an **Explicit Many-to-Many relationship**, where you manually define the foreign keys and the join table (like the `Like` table example).

### CRUD Operations with PRISMA ORM

Prisma provides a robust set of methods to perform various **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations and more, allowing you to interact with the database in a straightforward, type-safe way.

Here are the **most commonly used Prisma methods** for working with your database models:

---

### **1. Create Operations**

- **`create`**: Creates a new record in the database.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        name: 'Alice',
        email: 'alice@example.com',
      },
    });
    ```
    
    This inserts a new user record into the database.
    
- **`createMany`**: Creates multiple records at once.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const users = await prisma.user.createMany({
      data: [
        { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
        { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' },
      ],
    });
    ```
    
    This creates multiple users in one query, which is more efficient for batch inserts.
    

---

Q. In the create operation when we write: 'prisma.user.create()'. In this line of code, 'user' is the reference to the table called 'User' ? 

**`user`** refers to the **`User` model** in your **Prisma schema** (`schema.prisma` file), which corresponds to the **`User` table** in your database.

### Explanation:

When you define models in Prisma, like this:

```

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
  posts Post[]
}
```

Prisma automatically generates a **Prisma Client** for you, which includes methods for interacting with each model. The Prisma Client exposes these models as objects that you can use in your code to perform operations (like `create`, `findMany`, etc.).

In this case, when you write `prisma.user`, you're accessing the generated Prisma Client for the `User` model, which allows you to perform database operations on the `User` table.

### Capitalization in Schema vs Client:

- In the Prisma schema (`schema.prisma` file), the model name is typically written with **PascalCase** (e.g., `User`).
- In the generated Prisma Client, the model is referenced with **camelCase** (e.g., `user`).

So:

- **`User`** in the Prisma schema defines the structure of your table in the database.
- **`prisma.user`** in your code is the Prisma Client object used to interact with the `User` table.

### Example:

Here’s how this works in practice:

### In your `schema.prisma` file:

```

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
  posts Post[]
}

```

This defines a `User` model, which Prisma maps to a table in your database.

### In your JavaScript or TypeScript code:

```jsx

const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@example.com',
  },
});
```

Here, `prisma.user` is the reference to the **`User` table** in your database, and `.create()` is the method that allows you to insert a new record into that table.

### Summary:

- **`User`** in the Prisma schema: Defines the model and table structure.
- **`prisma.user`** in the Prisma Client: Gives you access to the `User` table and lets you perform operations like `create`, `findMany`, etc.
- The **camelCase** version of the model (like `user`) is how you access it in your code, while the **PascalCase** version (like `User`) defines the model in the schema.

### **Additional Parameters for Create method in Prisma**

Q. Inside the create method, there is a nested object with 'data' holding the values that will be added as a single record in the table. Are there additional parameters that can be added to the .create method?

### **1. `data` (Required)**

The `data` object is where you specify the fields and values for the record you're creating. This is the only required parameter, and it directly corresponds to the fields in the model.

### Example:

```jsx

const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@example.com',
  },
});
```

In this example:

- The `data` object is creating a new user with a `name` of `'Alice'` and an `email` of `'alice@example.com'`.

---

### 2. **`include`**

The `include` option allows you to fetch related records **immediately after creating** the new record. This is especially useful when you want to retrieve associated data (e.g., related posts or other models) along with the newly created record.

### Example:

```jsx

const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@example.com',
    posts: {
      create: {
        title: 'First Post',
        content: 'Hello World!',
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    posts: true,
  },
});

```

In this example:

- A new user is created, and a related post is created simultaneously.
- **`include: { posts: true }`** fetches the newly created `posts` along with the `user` record in the response.

---

### 3. **`select`**

The `select` option allows you to specify which fields should be returned after the record is created. Instead of returning the entire record, you can choose to return only specific fields.

### Example:

```jsx

const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@example.com',
  },
  select: {
    name: true,
  },
});
```

In this example:

- The `select` option ensures that only the `name` field is returned after the user is created, even though the entire record was created in the database.

---

### 4. **`create` with Nested Writes (Relations)**

When creating a record, Prisma allows you to create related records in the same operation by using **nested writes**. For example, if a `User` has a one-to-many relationship with `Post`, you can create a `User` and one or more `Post` records in a single query.

### Example:

```jsx

const newUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@example.com',
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: 'First Post', content: 'Hello World!' },
        { title: 'Second Post', content: 'Prisma is cool!' },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

In this example:

- A new `User` is created, and two related `Post` records are created simultaneously.
- The `posts` key inside `data` is used to create multiple related `Post` records.

---

### 5. **`skipDuplicates`**

This option is used when you’re using the `createMany` method, which allows you to create multiple records in one query. The `skipDuplicates` option prevents an error if there are duplicate records based on unique fields.

### Example:

```jsx

const users = await prisma.user.createMany({
  data: [
    { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
    { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' },
  ],
  skipDuplicates: true,
});

```

In this example:

- If one of the users already exists (say with the same email), the record is skipped rather than causing an error.

(Note: `skipDuplicates` only works with `createMany`, not `create`.)

---

### 6. **`connect` (For Existing Relations)**

If you are creating a record and want to link it to an existing related record, you can use the `connect` option. This is useful for relationships where you don't want to create a new related record, but rather associate the new record with an existing one.

### Example:

```jsx

const newPost = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'My Post',
    content: 'This is a post',
    author: {
      connect: { id: 1 }, // Connects the post to an existing user with id = 1
    },
  },
});

```

In this example:

- A new `Post` is created, and it's associated with an existing `User` (the one with `id = 1`).
- **`connect`** is used to link the new post to an existing author instead of creating a new user.

---

### 7. **`connectOrCreate`**

This option is a combination of `connect` and `create`. If the related record already exists, Prisma will connect the new record to the existing one; if it doesn't exist, Prisma will create it.

### Example:

```jsx

const newPost = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Another Post',
    content: 'Prisma is amazing!',
    author: {
      connectOrCreate: {
        where: { email: 'alice@example.com' },
        create: { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
      },
    },
  },
});

```

In this example:

- If a `User` with the email `'alice@example.com'` already exists, Prisma connects the post to that user.
- If the user doesn't exist, Prisma creates a new user with that email and connects the post to them.

---

Q. Is ‘connectOrCreate’ is similar to UPSERT in SQL?

### **What is UPSERT in SQL?**

An **UPSERT** in SQL is a combination of **INSERT** and **UPDATE**. It either inserts a new record if it doesn’t exist or updates the existing record if it already exists. In SQL, this operation is typically done using a `MERGE` or `ON CONFLICT` clause (depending on the SQL dialect).

### Example of UPSERT in PostgreSQL:

```sql

INSERT INTO users (email, name)
VALUES ('alice@example.com', 'Alice')
ON CONFLICT (email)
DO UPDATE SET name = 'Alice Updated';

```

In this example:

- If a user with the email `alice@example.com` exists, the `name` field will be updated.
- If no such user exists, a new record will be inserted with the provided values.

### 2. **What is `connectOrCreate` in Prisma?**

In Prisma, **`connectOrCreate`** is used in the context of **relations**. It checks whether a related record exists, and if it doesn’t, Prisma will create a new related record. This operation happens when you’re dealing with **foreign key relationships**, rather than performing a direct UPSERT on a single table.

### Example of `connectOrCreate`:

```jsx

const newPost = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Prisma Post',
    content: 'Hello from Prisma!',
    author: {
      connectOrCreate: {
        where: { email: 'alice@example.com' },  // Check if the author exists by email
        create: { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },  // Create the author if not found
      },
    },
  },
});

```

In this example:

- Prisma first **checks** if an `author` with the email `'alice@example.com'` exists in the `User` table.
- If the author exists, Prisma will **connect** the new `Post` to that existing `author`.
- If the author doesn’t exist, Prisma will **create** a new `User` with the given email and name and then connect the post to that new user.

---

### Key Differences Between **UPSERT** and **`connectOrCreate`**:

1. **Context**:
    - **UPSERT** is typically used for inserting or updating records within a **single table**.
    - **`connectOrCreate`** is used for establishing or creating a **relationship** between tables (i.e., linking a new record to an existing related record or creating a new related record if necessary).
2. **Update Behavior**:
    - **UPSERT** performs an update if the record exists (i.e., it can change fields of the existing record).
    - **`connectOrCreate`** does not update the existing record. It only connects the new record to the existing one if the match is found or creates a new related record if it doesn’t exist.
3. **Usage in Prisma**:
    - Prisma doesn’t have a direct `UPSERT` method. Instead, Prisma’s **`upsert`** method can be used to implement the UPSERT-like functionality for a single table. But **`connectOrCreate`** is specifically for **relationships between tables**.

---

### 3. **UPSERT vs. `upsert` in Prisma**

If you want true UPSERT behavior in Prisma (i.e., either **insert** or **update** within a single table), Prisma provides the **`upsert`** method:

### Example of Prisma’s `upsert` method:

```jsx

const upsertUser = await prisma.user.upsert({
  where: { email: 'alice@example.com' },  // Look for an existing user by email
  update: { name: 'Alice Updated' },      // If found, update the name
  create: { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' }, // If not found, create a new user
});

```

In this example:

- If a user with the email `'alice@example.com'` exists, Prisma will **update** their `name`.
- If no such user exists, Prisma will **create** a new record with the provided values.

This behavior is directly analogous to an UPSERT in SQL, and **`upsert`** in Prisma can be used for single-table operations.

---

### **Comparison Summary:**

| Feature | UPSERT (SQL) | Prisma `connectOrCreate` | Prisma `upsert` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operation type | Insert or update | Connect or create related record | Insert or update within the same table |
| Context | Single table | Relations between tables | Single table |
| Updates existing records | Yes | No | Yes |
| Creates new record if not found | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### 8. **`disconnect` (Disconnecting Relations)**

If you need to create a record and **disconnect** any existing relations, you can use the `disconnect` option. This is more commonly used with **update** operations but can be relevant in nested writes during creation as well.

### Example:

```jsx
javascript
Copy code
const updatedUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@example.com',
    posts: {
      create: { title: 'My post', content: 'Hello World!' },
      disconnect: { id: 2 }, // Disconnect an existing post with id = 2
    },
  },
});

```

---

### Summary of `.create()` Parameters:

1. **`data`** (Required): Contains the values for the new record.
2. **`include`**: Fetch related records after creation.
3. **`select`**: Specify which fields to return after creation.
4. **`create` with Nested Writes**: Create related records (e.g., posts for a user) in the same query.
5. **`skipDuplicates`** (createMany only): Skip duplicate records based on unique fields.
6. **`connect`**: Link the new record to an existing related record.
7. **`connectOrCreate`**: Either connect to an existing related record or create it if it doesn't exist.
8. **`disconnect`**: Disconnect related records (more common with updates but possible with create).

---

### Example Using Multiple Parameters:

```jsx

const newPost = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Advanced Prisma Post',
    content: 'Learning all the Prisma tricks!',
    author: {
      connectOrCreate: {
        where: { email: 'alice@example.com' },
        create: { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    author: true,
  },
});

```

This creates a post, connects or creates a related author, and includes the author details in the result.

### **2. Read Operations (Queries)**

- **`findUnique`**: Finds a single record by a unique field (like `id` or another `@unique` field).
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: {
        id: 1,
      },
    });
    ```
    
    This fetches the user with `id = 1`.
    
- **`findMany`**: Finds multiple records that match the provided filter.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
      where: {
        email: {
          contains: 'example.com',
        },
      },
    });
    ```
    
    This fetches all users whose email contains `'example.com'`.
    
- **`findFirst`**: Fetches the first record that matches the filter.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({
      where: {
        name: 'Alice',
      },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This fetches the first user named Alice, if more than one exists.
    

---

### **3. Update Operations**

- **`update`**: Updates a single record based on a unique identifier.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
      where: { id: 1 },
      data: { email: 'alice@newdomain.com' },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This updates the email of the user with `id = 1`.
    
- **`updateMany`**: Updates multiple records that match the filter criteria.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const updatedUsers = await prisma.user.updateMany({
      where: { name: 'Alice' },
      data: { email: 'alice@newdomain.com' },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This updates the email for all users named "Alice."
    

---

### **4. Delete Operations**

- **`delete`**: Deletes a single record by a unique identifier.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const deletedUser = await prisma.user.delete({
      where: { id: 1 },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This deletes the user with `id = 1`.
    
- **`deleteMany`**: Deletes multiple records that match a given filter.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const deletedUsers = await prisma.user.deleteMany({
      where: { email: { contains: 'example.com' } },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This deletes all users whose email contains `'example.com'`.
    

---

### **5. Aggregate and Count Operations**

- **`count`**: Counts the number of records that match the given filter.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
      where: { email: { contains: 'example.com' } },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This counts how many users have emails containing `'example.com'`.
    
- **`aggregate`**: Performs aggregate functions like `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, and `count` on records.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const aggregateResult = await prisma.post.aggregate({
      _count: true,
      _avg: {
        likes: true,
      },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This returns the total count of posts and the average number of likes.
    

---

### **6. Upsert Operation (Update or Create)**

- **`upsert`**: Either updates an existing record if it exists, or creates a new one if it doesn’t.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const upsertUser = await prisma.user.upsert({
      where: { email: 'alice@example.com' },
      update: { name: 'Alice Updated' },
      create: {
        name: 'Alice',
        email: 'alice@example.com',
      },
    });
    
    ```
    
    If a user with the given email exists, it updates their name. If not, it creates a new user.
    

---

### **7. Relation Queries (Fetching Related Data)**

- **`include`**: Fetch related records (e.g., posts for a user).
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const userWithPosts = await prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { id: 1 },
      include: { posts: true },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This fetches a user with their associated posts.
    
- **`select`**: Fetch only specific fields, instead of the whole record.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const userName = await prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { id: 1 },
      select: { name: true },
    });
    
    ```
    
    This fetches only the `name` field of the user.
    

---

### **8. Transactional Operations**

- **`$transaction`**: Executes multiple Prisma Client queries within a single transaction (so they either all succeed or all fail together).
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const [newUser, newPost] = await prisma.$transaction([
      prisma.user.create({
        data: { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
      }),
      prisma.post.create({
        data: { title: 'Alice\'s First Post', content: 'Hello World!' },
      }),
    ]);
    
    ```
    
    Both the user and post are created in one transaction, ensuring data consistency.
    

---

### **9. Disconnecting the Prisma Client**

- **`$disconnect`**: Closes the connection to the database.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    await prisma.$disconnect();
    
    ```
    
    This ensures the database connection is closed when your application is finished running.
    

---

### **10. Raw Queries**

- **`$queryRaw`**: Executes raw SQL queries directly.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const rawResult = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE email = ${email}`;
    
    ```
    
    This allows you to run custom SQL queries within Prisma.
    
- **`$executeRaw`**: Executes a raw SQL query that doesn’t return rows, such as an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    
    await prisma.$executeRaw`DELETE FROM "User" WHERE id = ${userId}`;
    ```
    

---

### Aggregate operators in Prisma

### **Common Aggregate Functions in Prisma:**

1. **_count** – Counts the number of records that match a query.
2. **_sum** – Calculates the sum of a numeric field.
3. **_avg** – Finds the average of a numeric field.
4. **_min** – Returns the minimum value in a field.
5. **_max** – Returns the maximum value in a field.

You can apply these aggregate functions either when grouping data (with `groupBy`) or on their own using the `aggregate` method without grouping.

### **Basic Syntax for Aggregation**

Here’s an example of how to use Prisma's `aggregate` function to perform different types of calculations.

Imagine you want to get some statistics on the **rental_duration** and **rental_rate** from the **film** table of the **DVDRental** database.

### 1. **Counting Records with `_count`**

You can count the total number of films in the **film** table like this:

```jsx

const totalFilms = await prisma.film.aggregate({
  _count: {
    film_id: true,  // Count the number of films by counting film_id
  },
});
console.log(totalFilms);
```

The result would be an object showing the total count:

```json

{ _count: { film_id: 1000 } } // Assuming there are 1000 films in the database.

```

### 2. **Summing Numeric Values with `_sum`**

Let’s say you want to sum the **rental_duration** of all films:

```jsx

const totalRentalDuration = await prisma.film.aggregate({
  _sum: {
    rental_duration: true,  // Sum all rental_duration values
  },
});
console.log(totalRentalDuration);
```

This would give the total rental duration across all films:

```json

{ _sum: { rental_duration: 4500 } }  // Hypothetical result

```

### 3. **Averaging Numeric Values with `_avg`**

You can also calculate the average **rental_rate** across all films:

```jsx

const averageRentalRate = await prisma.film.aggregate({
  _avg: {
    rental_rate: true,  // Calculate the average rental_rate
  },
});
console.log(averageRentalRate);

```

The output would be:

```json

{ _avg: { rental_rate: 3.50 } }  // Hypothetical result

```

### 4. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values with `_min` and `_max`**

If you want to find the **minimum** and **maximum** **rental_rate**, you can do it like this:

```jsx

const rentalRateBounds = await prisma.film.aggregate({
  _min: {
    rental_rate: true,  // Find the minimum rental_rate
  },
  _max: {
    rental_rate: true,  // Find the maximum rental_rate
  },
});
console.log(rentalRateBounds);

```

The result will show both the minimum and maximum rental rates:

```json

{ _min: { rental_rate: 0.99 }, _max: { rental_rate: 5.99 } }  // Hypothetical result

```

---

### **Combining Multiple Aggregations**

Prisma allows you to use multiple aggregate functions in the same query. Let’s combine `_count`, `_avg`, and `_sum` into a single query to get a comprehensive overview:

```jsx
javascript
Copy code
const filmStats = await prisma.film.aggregate({
  _count: {
    film_id: true,
  },
  _avg: {
    rental_rate: true,
  },
  _sum: {
    rental_duration: true,
  },
});
console.log(filmStats);

```

This query gives you the total number of films, the average rental rate, and the sum of all rental durations:

```json
json
Copy code
{
  _count: { film_id: 1000 },  // Total number of films
  _avg: { rental_rate: 3.50 },  // Average rental rate
  _sum: { rental_duration: 4500 }  // Total rental duration
}

```

---

### **Use Cases for Aggregate Functions**

- **Summarizing Data**: You can quickly summarize large amounts of data, such as finding the total revenue, number of customers, or average sales amount.
- **Optimizing Queries**: Aggregation can allow you to perform calculations directly in the database instead of pulling all records into your application and calculating there, which can be much slower.
- **Data Analytics**: Aggregate functions are essential in generating reports or dashboards, where you need aggregated metrics such as averages, counts, or sums.

### **Advanced Querying in Prisma**

Comparison operators in Prisma:

Here are the common comparison operators in Prisma:

1. **Greater than (`gt`)**:
    - **Syntax**: `gt`
    - Example: `rental_duration: { gt: 5 }` (Finds records where `rental_duration` is greater than 5).
2. **Greater than or equal to (`gte`)**:
    - **Syntax**: `gte`
    - Example: `rental_duration: { gte: 5 }` (Finds records where `rental_duration` is greater than or equal to 5).
3. **Less than (`lt`)**:
    - **Syntax**: `lt`
    - Example: `rental_duration: { lt: 5 }` (Finds records where `rental_duration` is less than 5).
4. **Less than or equal to (`lte`)**:
    - **Syntax**: `lte`
    - Example: `rental_duration: { lte: 5 }` (Finds records where `rental_duration` is less than or equal to 5).
5. **Not equal to (`not`)**:
    - **Syntax**: `not`
    - Example: `rental_duration: { not: 5 }` (Finds records where `rental_duration` is not equal to 5).
6. **Equality (`equals`)**:
    - **Syntax**: `equals`
    - Example: `rental_duration: { equals: 5 }` (Finds records where `rental_duration` is exactly equal to 5).

### Example with multiple comparison operators:

```jsx

const movies = await prisma.film.findMany({
  where: {
    rental_duration: {
      gte: 5,  // greater than or equal to 5
      lt: 10,  // less than 10
    },
    rating: {
      not: 'PG',  // not equal to 'PG'
    },
  },
});
```

In this query:

- `rental_duration` is between 5 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive).
- `rating` is not equal to `'PG'`.

WHERE and ORDER BY in Prisma

In Prisma, you use the `where` argument to filter records. You can filter based on various conditions like equality, inequality, or even more complex conditions like “contains” or ranges. Here’s an example:

Let’s say you want to get all **films** from the **DVDRental** database where the rating is “PG-13”:

```jsx

const pg13Movies = await prisma.film.findMany({
  where: {
    rating: 'PG-13',
  },
});

```

You can also use advanced filtering with conditions like **greater than** or **less than**. For example, let’s retrieve all movies with a rental duration greater than 5:

```jsx

const longDurationMovies = await prisma.film.findMany({
  where: {
    rental_duration: {
      gt: 5, // greater than 5
    },
  },
});
```

### **Sorting Queries**

You can sort records using the `orderBy` argument. This can be done on any field. For instance, if you want to get a list of films sorted by their **rental rate** in descending order, you would do something like this:

```jsx

const sortedMovies = await prisma.film.findMany({
  orderBy: {
    rental_rate: 'desc', // sorts in descending order
  },
});

```

You can combine **filtering** and **sorting** together. For example, getting all “PG-13” movies sorted by rental rate:

```jsx

const pg13SortedMovies = await prisma.film.findMany({
  where: {
    rating: 'PG-13',
  },
  orderBy: {
    rental_rate: 'desc',
  },
});
```

### Pagination in Prisma

Pagination in Prisma allows you to manage large sets of data by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Prisma provides several mechanisms to handle pagination:

- **`take`**: Limits the number of records returned (similar to SQL’s `LIMIT`).
- **`skip`**: Skips a certain number of records before fetching results (useful for page-based pagination).
- **`cursor`**: Acts as a pointer to a specific record, allowing pagination to start after a specific item (useful for cursor-based pagination).

Let’s dive into how each of these works, and we’ll use examples to make it more clear.

---

### 1. **`take`: Limit the Number of Results**

The `take` argument is used to limit how many records are returned in a query. It’s equivalent to the SQL `LIMIT` clause.

Example: Fetch the first 5 customers from the `customer` table:

```jsx

const customers = await prisma.customer.findMany({
  take: 5, // Fetch only 5 customers
});
```

This query will return an array of 5 customer records.

---

### 2. **`skip`: Skip a Certain Number of Records**

The `skip` argument allows you to skip a specific number of records before retrieving the results. This is useful when implementing page-based pagination, where you skip over records that belong to previous pages.

Example: Fetch 5 customers, but skip the first 5 (i.e., get the next 5 customers after the first page):

```jsx

const customers = await prisma.customer.findMany({
  skip: 5,  // Skip the first 5 records
  take: 5,  // Then fetch the next 5 customers
});
```

This query effectively implements page 2 of a paginated list (if each page shows 5 customers).

---

### 3. **`cursor`: Pagination Based on a Specific Record**

The `cursor` argument is used for **cursor-based pagination**. It allows you to start fetching records after a specific item. Unlike `skip`, which counts records, `cursor` lets you paginate based on the data itself. This can be more efficient and avoids issues where the data might change between pages (like when new records are added or removed).

To use a cursor, you need to pass a unique identifier to the `cursor` argument. This tells Prisma to fetch records starting **after** the record identified by the cursor.

Example: Fetch the next 5 customers after a specific customer (say, with `customer_id: 10`):

```jsx
const customers = await prisma.customer.findMany({
  cursor: {
    customer_id: 10,  // Use the `customer_id` as the cursor to start after this record
  },
  skip: 1,  // Skip the current record (customer with ID 10)
  take: 5,  // Fetch the next 5 customers after the cursor
});
```

This query returns the next 5 customers after the one with `customer_id` 10.

---

### **Combining `take`, `skip`, and `cursor` for Pagination**

In a practical use case, you can combine these arguments to handle more advanced pagination. Let’s assume you’re building an API that returns customers in pages of 5 records at a time, with an option to paginate using a cursor.

### Example: Paginating Using `take`, `skip`, and `cursor`

Let’s say you are on page 3 and each page has 5 customers. You want to skip the first 10 customers (for pages 1 and 2) and fetch 5 more customers starting from the 11th record:

```jsx

const customers = await prisma.customer.findMany({
  skip: 10,  // Skip the first 10 records
  take: 5,   // Fetch the next 5 records (for page 3)
});
```

Or, you could use a **cursor-based** approach, which is more efficient for larger datasets and prevents inconsistencies when the data changes (i.e., records are inserted or deleted):

```jsx

const customers = await prisma.customer.findMany({
  cursor: {
    customer_id: 15,  // Assume customer with ID 15 is the last customer on page 2
  },
  skip: 1,  // Skip the customer with ID 15
  take: 5,  // Fetch the next 5 customers (for page 3)
});

```

### **Benefits of Cursor-Based Pagination:**

- **Consistency**: `cursor` avoids issues where data might change between page loads (like new records being inserted or old ones being deleted).
- **Scalability**: It's better suited for large datasets because `skip` becomes inefficient as the number of skipped rows increases (since the database still processes all skipped rows).

---

### **Practical Pagination Example in an API**

Here’s a basic example of how you could implement pagination in a REST API using `take` and `skip`:

```jsx
javascript
Copy code
app.get('/customers', async (req, res) => {
  const page = parseInt(req.query.page) || 1; // Default to page 1 if no page is provided
  const limit = 5; // We want 5 records per page
  const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

  try {
    const customers = await prisma.customer.findMany({
      skip: skip,   // Calculate the number of records to skip
      take: limit,  // Fetch only the next 5 customers
    });

    res.status(200).json(customers);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error fetching customers', details: error.message });
  }
});

```

In this example:

- The API accepts a `page` query parameter.
- It calculates the number of records to skip based on the page.
- It fetches 5 records per page (adjust this to whatever number you need).

### **Composite Primary Keys and Indexes in Prisma**

In Prisma, you can define **composite primary keys** and **indexes** in your models to enforce uniqueness across multiple fields or optimise query performance. Composite primary keys involve more than one field acting together as a primary key, while composite indexes improve search efficiency for complex queries.

Let’s break down how to create both **composite primary keys** and **indexes** in Prisma, and when you might want to use them.

---

### **1. Composite Primary Keys**

A **composite primary key** is a primary key made up of more than one field. This ensures that the combination of fields is unique, rather than a single field.

### **When to Use Composite Primary Keys:**

- When no single field can uniquely identify a record.
- When you want to ensure uniqueness based on the combination of two or more fields.

For example, in a **Many-to-Many** relationship, an intermediate table that connects two entities (such as **students and courses** or **films and categories**) often uses a composite primary key.

---

### **Creating Composite Primary Keys in Prisma**

To define a composite primary key, you use the `@@id` directive, which allows you to specify multiple fields as the primary key.

### **Example: Composite Primary Key for a Many-to-Many Relationship**

Imagine a **FilmCategory** model where each film can belong to many categories, and each category can have many films. This would typically be modeled with a composite key, made up of `film_id` and `category_id`.

Here’s how you can define it in Prisma:

```jsx

model FilmCategory {
  film_id     Int
  category_id Int
  film        Film     @relation(fields: [film_id], references: [film_id])
  category    Category @relation(fields: [category_id], references: [category_id])

  @@id([film_id, category_id]) // Composite primary key
}

```

### Explanation:

- **Fields**: The `film_id` and `category_id` fields together make up the primary key. No single `film_id` or `category_id` can be unique on its own, but their combination is.
- **`@@id([field1, field2])`**: This directive specifies that both fields (`film_id` and `category_id`) together act as the primary key. This means that Prisma enforces uniqueness on the combination of these fields.

### Why Use Composite Primary Keys?

- **Relational Integrity**: This ensures that the same `film_id` and `category_id` combination cannot appear more than once in the table.
- **Efficient Queries**: Composite keys provide more flexibility when defining relationships between tables.

---

### **2. Composite Indexes in Prisma**

An **index** is a way to improve query performance by creating a sorted copy of certain fields. Prisma supports creating **composite indexes**, which allow you to create an index across multiple fields.

### **When to Use Composite Indexes:**

- When you query multiple fields together frequently and want to optimize query speed.
- When the order of the fields in the query matters for performance.
- To enforce uniqueness across a combination of fields without making them a primary key.

---

### **Creating Composite Indexes in Prisma**

To define a composite index, you use the `@@index` or `@@unique` directives.

### **Example: Composite Index on Two Fields**

Let’s say you have a **User** model, and you want to create an index on both the `first_name` and `last_name` fields because you often query users by their full names.

Here’s how you can define a composite index:

```jsx

model User {
  id         Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  first_name String
  last_name  String
  email      String @unique

  @@index([first_name, last_name])  // Composite index on first_name and last_name
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`@@index([field1, field2])`**: This creates an index on the `first_name` and `last_name` fields, improving the performance of queries that involve both fields, like `WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe'`.

### **Query Performance Benefit:**

If you frequently search for users by their first and last names together, this index will speed up those queries because the database can quickly look up the values using the index instead of scanning the whole table.

### **Example Query Using Composite Index:**

```jsx

const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe'
  }
});
```

Because we’ve indexed both `first_name` and `last_name`, this query will be faster, as it can directly access the indexed data rather than performing a full table scan.

---

### **Creating Unique Composite Indexes in Prisma**

Sometimes, you need to enforce that a combination of two fields is **unique**, even though neither field is unique on its own. This is where a **unique composite index** is helpful.

### **Example: Unique Composite Index on Two Fields**

Let’s assume you want to ensure that no two users can have the same combination of `first_name` and `email`.

```jsx

model User {
  id         Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  first_name String
  email      String

  @@unique([first_name, email])  // Unique composite index on first_name and email
}

```

### Explanation:

- **`@@unique([field1, field2])`**: This ensures that the combination of `first_name` and `email` is unique across all users. While multiple users can have the same `first_name` or the same `email` separately, no two users can have both the same `first_name` **and** `email`.

---

### **3. Composite Keys vs. Composite Indexes**

It’s important to understand the difference between composite primary keys and composite indexes:

| **Feature** | **Composite Primary Key** | **Composite Index** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Uniquely identifies records in the table | Speeds up queries or enforces unique combinations |
| **Uniqueness** | Automatically enforces uniqueness on the fields | Can enforce uniqueness (if `@@unique`) or just index multiple fields |
| **Used in Relationships** | Yes, usually for connecting related tables | No, used mainly for query performance and data constraints |
| **SQL Equivalent** | PRIMARY KEY (field1, field2) | INDEX (field1, field2) or UNIQUE INDEX (field1, field2) |

---

### **4. Practical Examples: Composite Primary Key and Indexes**

### **Example 1: Defining a Composite Primary Key for an Order-Product Relationship**

Suppose you have an **Order** and **Product** model, and a join table called **OrderProduct**. Each order can have multiple products, and each product can be part of multiple orders. The composite key would be a combination of `order_id` and `product_id` to ensure uniqueness in this many-to-many relationship.

```jsx
model OrderProduct {
  order_id   Int
  product_id Int
  order      Order   @relation(fields: [order_id], references: [id])
  product    Product @relation(fields: [product_id], references: [id])

  @@id([order_id, product_id])  // Composite primary key
}
```

### **Example 2: Defining a Composite Index on Posts**

Let’s say you have a **Post** model, and you want to create an index on both the `title` and `createdAt` fields to optimize queries that filter posts by their title and the date they were created.

```jsx

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([title, createdAt])  // Composite index on title and createdAt
}

```

This will improve the performance of queries that search posts by their title and the date they were created.

### **Example 3: Unique Composite Index on Username and Email**

If you want to ensure that the combination of `username` and `email` is unique for every user, you can use a unique composite index:

```jsx

model User {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  username String
  email    String

  @@unique([username, email])  // Unique composite index on username and email
}

```

This ensures that while users can have the same `username` or `email` separately, no two users can have the same combination of `username` and `email`.

---

### **5. Summary**

- **Composite Primary Keys (`@@id`)**: These combine multiple fields to uniquely identify each record. They are commonly used in join tables for many-to-many relationships.
    
    **Example**: `@@id([film_id, category_id])`
    
- **Composite Indexes (`@@index`)**: These improve the performance of queries involving multiple fields. They can also enforce uniqueness if you use the `@@unique` directive.
    
    **Example**: `@@index([first_name, last_name])`
    
- **Unique Composite Indexes (`@@unique`)**: These enforce uniqueness across multiple fields, even if neither field is unique individually.
    
    **Example**: `@@unique([first_name, email])`
    

---

### **Transactions in Prisma ORM**

When working with databases, transactions are a fundamental concept for ensuring data consistency and integrity, especially when multiple database operations need to succeed or fail together. In Prisma, you can perform multiple operations within a **transaction** to ensure that either all operations complete successfully, or none of them are applied (in case of failure).

Prisma provides an API for transactions, with the most commonly used method being **`prisma.$transaction()`**, which supports atomic transactions.

### **1. Atomic Transactions in Prisma**

An **atomic transaction** ensures that a series of database operations either **all succeed** or **none of them are applied**. This is crucial for operations that involve multiple dependent actions. For example:

- Creating a user and their associated profile
- Updating a product and the associated inventory

Atomic transactions are handled by the database itself, and Prisma provides an easy way to work with transactions using `prisma.$transaction()`.

### **When to Use Transactions:**

- When you need to **ensure data integrity** across multiple operations.
- When you want to avoid partial updates if one operation fails (e.g., in banking, transferring money between accounts requires a transaction so that either both accounts are updated or neither is).
- For **batch operations** where you want to ensure that all records are inserted, updated, or deleted together.

---

### **2. Using `prisma.$transaction()`**

Prisma’s `prisma.$transaction()` function allows you to execute multiple database operations in a single transaction.

### **Basic Example: Two Operations in a Transaction**

Suppose you are working with a **user** and **profile** model, and you want to ensure that the creation of a user and their profile happens atomically.

Here’s how you can use `prisma.$transaction()`:

```jsx
javascript
Copy code
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function createUserWithProfile() {
  const transaction = await prisma.$transaction([
    prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john.doe@example.com'
      }
    }),
    prisma.profile.create({
      data: {
        bio: 'Hello, I am John',
        user: {
          connect: { email: 'john.doe@example.com' }  // Link the user by email
        }
      }
    })
  ]);

  return transaction;
}

createUserWithProfile()
  .then(result => {
    console.log('Transaction completed:', result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });

```

### Explanation:

- **`prisma.$transaction([operation1, operation2])`**: This runs both operations inside a transaction.
    - If **both operations** succeed, the data is committed to the database.
    - If either operation fails (e.g., the user creation fails due to a unique constraint violation), **none of the operations** are applied, and all changes are rolled back.
- **Advantages of `prisma.$transaction()`**:
    - **Atomicity**: Ensures that either all operations succeed or none.
    - **Consistency**: Useful for keeping related data consistent (e.g., creating a user and their profile).
    - **Performance**: Can optimize performance by batching operations.

---

### **3. Performing Multiple Operations in a Transaction**

In Prisma, you can chain multiple operations inside a transaction. Let’s assume you need to:

1. Create a new order.
2. Update the customer’s balance.
3. Add a log entry for the transaction.

Here’s how you could use `prisma.$transaction()` for this scenario:

```jsx
javascript
Copy code
async function processOrder(orderData) {
  const transaction = await prisma.$transaction([
    prisma.order.create({
      data: {
        customerId: orderData.customerId,
        totalAmount: orderData.totalAmount
      }
    }),
    prisma.customer.update({
      where: { id: orderData.customerId },
      data: {
        balance: {
          decrement: orderData.totalAmount
        }
      }
    }),
    prisma.transactionLog.create({
      data: {
        customerId: orderData.customerId,
        action: 'Order Created',
        amount: orderData.totalAmount
      }
    })
  ]);

  return transaction;
}

```

### Explanation:

- **Create an order** for the customer.
- **Update the customer’s balance** by decrementing it.
- **Log the transaction** for audit purposes.
- If any one of these operations fails, the whole transaction is rolled back, and none of the operations take effect.

---

### **4. Optimizing Transactions in Prisma**

While transactions ensure consistency, they also come with overhead, and it’s important to know how to optimize them for performance and scalability.

### **When to Optimize Transactions:**

- **Complex transactions** with many operations can slow down database performance if not handled efficiently.
- **Long-running transactions** (where a transaction is open for a long time) can lock database rows, reducing throughput.

### **Tips for Optimizing Transactions:**

1. **Keep Transactions Short and Focused**:
    - Only perform the necessary operations inside the transaction. For example, avoid running unnecessary calculations or external API calls within a transaction. Keep the transaction limited to database operations.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    javascript
    Copy code
    async function optimizedTransaction(userId, productId, quantity) {
      const result = await prisma.$transaction([
        prisma.user.update({
          where: { id: userId },
          data: { balance: { decrement: quantity * 10 } } // Subtract cost from balance
        }),
        prisma.product.update({
          where: { id: productId },
          data: { stock: { decrement: quantity } }  // Subtract from stock
        })
      ]);
    
      return result;
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Batch Queries in Transactions**:
    - If you are performing multiple similar operations (e.g., updating multiple rows), batch them together within a single transaction rather than making individual requests.
    
    **Example: Batch Update:**
    
    ```jsx
    javascript
    Copy code
    async function updateMultipleOrders(orders) {
      const operations = orders.map(order => {
        return prisma.order.update({
          where: { id: order.id },
          data: { status: 'completed' }
        });
      });
    
      const transaction = await prisma.$transaction(operations);  // Batch updates in a transaction
      return transaction;
    }
    
    ```
    
3. **Use Proper Indexing**:
    - Indexing can significantly improve the speed of transactions, especially when updating or querying large tables. Ensure that frequently accessed fields in your transactions are indexed (e.g., `customer_id` in the **Order** table).
4. **Avoid Long-Lived Transactions**:
    - Long-lived transactions can lead to performance bottlenecks because they hold locks on rows until they complete, potentially blocking other operations. Keep the scope of the transaction narrow and short to avoid contention.
5. **Transaction Isolation Levels** (Database-Specific Optimization):
    - While Prisma does not currently provide control over transaction isolation levels, understanding how your database handles isolation (e.g., PostgreSQL’s **Serializable**, **Repeatable Read**) can help in optimizing performance. For example, you may want to lower the isolation level for high-concurrency applications.

---

### **5. Best Practices for Using `prisma.$transaction()`**

1. **Use Transactions for Critical Sections Only**:
    - Only wrap code in a transaction when necessary, such as when performing multiple writes that must succeed together.
2. **Always Handle Errors**:
    - Always catch errors when using transactions, as any one of the operations might fail and you’ll need to handle that gracefully.
    
    ```jsx
    javascript
    Copy code
    prisma.$transaction([
      prisma.operation1(),
      prisma.operation2(),
    ]).catch(error => {
      console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
    });
    
    ```
    
3. **Monitor Transaction Duration**:
    - Use tools like database performance monitoring to detect slow or long-lived transactions, and refactor them to optimize their duration and lock contention.

---

### **6. Practice Challenge**

1. **Create a Transaction**: Write a Prisma transaction to:
    - Create a new customer.
    - Add an order for that customer.
    - Update the stock of the product being ordered.
2. **Optimize a Batch Update**: Create a Prisma transaction to batch update the status of 10 orders from "pending" to "shipped," ensuring the operation is optimized and atomic.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **`prisma.$transaction()`** allows you to execute multiple operations in a single transaction, ensuring either all operations succeed or none are applied.
- **Optimization**: Keep transactions short, batch similar operations, and ensure that you handle any errors gracefully.
- Transactions are a powerful tool for ensuring consistency, and optimizing them will help improve both performance and reliability.
